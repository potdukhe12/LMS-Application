# School Management System

## Overview

This School Management System is a web-based application developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). It provides a comprehensive solution for managing various aspects of a school, including student information, class schedules, attendance, and more.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure authentication system for administrators, teachers, parents and students.
- **Student Management**: Track student information, academic records, and attendance.
- **Class Scheduling**: Efficiently manage class schedules and teacher assignments.
- **Attendance Tracking**: Record and monitor student attendance easily.
- **Gradebook**: Keep track of student grades and academic performance.


## Installation

Follow the steps below to set up and run the School Management System locally.

### Backend

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:

    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2. Install backend dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the backend server(with nodemon):

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

   The backend server will run at `http://localhost:5000`.


### Frontend

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2. Install frontend dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the frontend development server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

   The frontend development server will run at `http://localhost:3000`.


### Concurrently (Optional)
    
Alternatively, you can run both frontend and backend concurrently from the project root:

    npm start

This will use concurrently to run the frontend and backend servers simultaneously.
